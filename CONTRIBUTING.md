# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome any contributions made by the community to improve Chard and
fix bugs. Please agree to the following before contributing.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the Chard project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Takota Limited.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Please open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This clause is in place in case we release a commercial 'pro version'
of Chard in the future. The core of Chard will always remain open source and
free to use, but in order for this project to be sustainable in the long-term
we may decide to create a commercial addon with additional features that
is commercially licensed.
